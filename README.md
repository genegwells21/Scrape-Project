# Scrape-Project

This assignment was riveting. It had elements of mongoose that were highly intuitive. I enjoyed rearching and making calls based on activities in class. The process of implementing personal facets to this application were crucial to the completion of the app. This was an engaging application.
Thank you.
In server.js I created my dependencies. I then connected mongoose and created initial methods. I then initialized my requests for scraping.
In my app.js I set up ajax and configured receiving and sending JSON information to a capacity where it would function amazingly.
The article.js and note.js enabled me to have a process of defining types and strings through the useful uses of Schemas.
We now have a finished product that is innovative and succint!
